Sometimes I can't get words out of my head.
Sometimes I can't pull the effort to bring out a smile.
Sometimes I feel I can't do something without ruining someone's day.
Sometimes I feel as empty as the pacific ocean.

Everytime I do anything, I feel like I'm not good enough.
Everytime I wish my water bottle was full, it could fill my empty heart.
Everytime I can't sleep, my head gets disturbed.
Everytime I get out in the sunshine, I wish to get back home.
